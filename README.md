# Project Title:
Predicting Iris Species Using Machine Learning Algorithms

# Project Overview :
This project applies machine learning techniques to the Iris dataset to classify iris flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. It involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and building classification models to predict flower species based on sepal and petal dimensions. The project demonstrates the effectiveness of supervised learning in solving classification problems.

# Installation and Setup
    - Install the required Python libraries by running:
         - import numpy as np
         - import pandas as pd
         - import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
         - import seaborn as sns
         - from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
         - from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier
         - from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
         - from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier, GradientBoostingClassifier
         - from sklearn.svm import SVC

# Data:
 - Source Data:
          The Iris dataset was obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, a standard benchmark dataset for machine learning tasks.

 - Data Acquisition:
          The dataset consists of 150 observations and includes the following features:
            - Sepal Length
            - Sepal Width
            - Petal Length
            - Petal Width
            - Target Species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica).
# Data Preprocessing:
     - Missing values: Checked and addressed.
     - Feature scaling: Normalized features for model compatibility.
     - Data splitting: The dataset was split into training and testing sets.

# Code Structure:
     - data/: Contains the Iris dataset .
     - notebooks/: Includes the Jupyter notebook for exploration and modeling.
     - src/: Contains Python scripts for preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
     - results/: Stores visualizations, evaluation metrics, and predictions.

# Usage:
